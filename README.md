This example demonstrates a subtle bug in ActionScript related to accessing array elements beyond the bounds of the array.  ActionScript, unlike some languages, does not throw an error when you try to access an element outside the array's index. Instead, it silently returns undefined. This can lead to difficult-to-debug issues, especially in larger projects. The solution shows how to safely access elements using a check.
